# 📝 Challenge 12: Student Report Card

## Problem Statement

Create a `Student` class in C++ with the following attributes:
- `name` (string)
- `rollNumber` (int)
- `marks` (array of 3 integers — marks for 3 subjects)

Implement member functions to:
1. Input student details
2. Calculate average marks
3. Determine grade based on average:
   - `90+` ➝ Grade A  
   - `75–89` ➝ Grade B  
   - `50–74` ➝ Grade C  
   - `< 50` ➝ Grade D
4. Display all student information, average, and grade

Support multiple student records.

### Input
- First line: integer `n` — number of students
- For each student:
  - Name
  - Roll number
  - Marks of 3 subjects

### Output
- Display for each student: Name, Roll No., Marks, Average, and Grade
