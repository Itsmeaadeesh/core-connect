# ðŸ”¢ Challenge 13: Convert Binary to Decimal

## Problem Statement

Write a C++ program to convert a **binary number** (input as an integer or string) into its **decimal equivalent**.

You must use **loops or custom functions** â€” do not use built-in converters like `stoi()` with base 2.

### Input
- A binary number (only 0s and 1s), up to 32 bits, as a string or integer.

### Output
- A single integer â€” the decimal equivalent.
